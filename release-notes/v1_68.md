# May 2022 (version 1.68)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.68 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/149008)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Settings editor improvements

The Settings editor now shows a default value override indicator for language-specific settings. As a note, one can view language-specific settings by adding a language filter in the Settings editor search bar, and one can add such a filter either by typing it out explicitly, or by clicking the filter button on the right of the search bar, and selecting the "Language" option.

When the default value override indicator shows up, it indicates that the default value of the language-specific setting has been overridden by an extension. The indicator also indicates which extension overrode the default value.

![Settings editor default override indicator showing up for the editor wordwrap setting when there is a Markdown language filter in place. The default override indicator indicates that the default value of the language-specific setting was overridden by the Markdown Language Features extension](images/1_68/settings-editor-language-specific-default.gif)

This iteration also fixes a behavior where some links in the Settings editor were not redirecting properly when there was already a search query in the Settings editor search bar. The links also now have proper styling so that it is clearer when one is hovering over them.

![After searching for the word "font" in the Settings editor, and selecting the terminal category in the table of contents, the setting terminal.integrated.fontFamily shows up, and its description contains a link to the editor.fontFamily setting. Clicking on the link now brings you correctly to the setting.](images/1_68/settings-editor-working-links.gif)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

### Hide files in Explorer based on .gitignore

The File Explorer now supports parsing and hiding files that are excluded by your `.gitignore` file. This can be enabled via the `explorer.excludeGitIgnore` setting. This setting works alongside `files.exclude` to hide unwanted files from the Explorer.

**Note**: At this time negated globs such as `!package.json` are not parseable.

### Lock hovers

Some custom hovers cannot be moused over and others are tricky to mouse over without hiding it because of other things in the way (for example, a scroll bar). Holding `Alt` while a hover is active will now "lock" it, giving it a wider border and preventing moving the mouse outside of the hover widget or whatever triggered it from hiding it. This is primarily an accessibility feature to make hovers play nice with screen magnifiers but it is also useful for copying text from certain hovers. Note that this feature only applies outside of the editor because editor hovers can always be moused over unless specified otherwise via a setting.

![Holding alt while hovering an item in the extension view will add a 2 pixel border around it and allow mousing over it and selecting text](images/1_68/hover-lock.gif)

### Configure Display Language improvements

The **Configure Display Language** command has been refreshed to include:

* The name of the language in that language.
* An **Available languages** section that shows what languages aren't installed on your machine and selecting one will automatically install it and apply that language.

![configure display language command is refreshed](images/1_68/configure-display-language.png)

_Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)_

We think that this will help with discovering what language packs are available. Please let us know what you think!

### Problems panel table

This milestone we added a new capability for users to toggle the view mode of the Problems panel between treeview and table. Compared to the treeview, the table surfaces the source of each problem, which allows users to filter the problems by their source.

### Deprecated extensions

In this milestone, we have added support for deprecated extensions in VS Code. An extension is deprecated when it is no longer being maintained. Some extensions are deprecated when there are better alternative extensions available and some are deprecated when their functionality is built into VS Code. Here are some examples:

A deprecated extension that is no longer being maintained.

![deprecated extension with no maintenance](images/1_68/deprecated-extension.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

An extension deprecated in favour of another extension. In this case, VS Code does not allow users to install this extension.

![deprecated extension with alternative](images/1_68/deprecated-extension-alternate.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

A deprecated extension with its functionality built-in to VS Code which can be enabled by configuring settings.

![deprecated extension with builtin to VS Code](images/1_68/deprecated-extension-builtin.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

**Note:** The list of deprecated extensions is maintained by the VS Code. Please reach out to us, if you have an extension that you believe should be deprecated.

## Terminal

### Find match background color

Since last release find in the terminal would show a border around all matches, this was a temporary solution until support for changing the background of cells dynamically was possible. Background is now the default for themes and the overall experience should look very similar to the editor now.

![Find now uses the blue from the editor's find for the active match and the orange for highlights](images/1_68/terminal-find-bg.png)

If you're a theme author that adopted `terminal.findMatchBorder` or `terminal.findMatchHighlightBorder` we recommend migrating to `terminal.findMatchBackground` and `terminal.findMatchHighlightBackground` if that would fit the theme better or help contrast.

### Improvements to contrast and the minimum contrast ratio

The find match background work added a lot more flexibility in how the terminal works with background and foreground colors. Because of this, a lot of improvements were made around contrast in the terminal, aligning the terminal visuals closer to the editor and to the minimum contrast ratio feature that changes the foreground of text dynamically to help with visibility.

* Luminance will now go in the other direction if contrast isn't met. For example if contrast isn't met for dark grey text on a lighter grey background with pure black (#000000), the color will also try move towards white and the one that best meets the desired contrast ratio will be used.

  ![Darker grey on lighter dark can now use a light foreground color if needed](images/1_68/terminal-contrast-reverse.png)

* Selection is now drawn below the text when GPU acceleration is disabled and supports opaque colors, previous this had to be partially transparent and it would wash out the foreground color. Thanks to this change the selection color now uses the same color as in the editor.

  ![Foreground color are retained in selections](images/1_68/terminal-contrast-dom.png)

* Nerd font symbols should now apply minimum contrast ratio to blend in with nearby text while powerline symbols and box drawing characters will **not** apply minimum contrast ratio as they are often adjacent to inverted cells without any foreground characters.

  ![Powerlines no longer have odd colors between the colored sections](images/1_68/terminal-contrast-powerlines.png)

* Themes can now specify a fixed selection foreground color, this is used by default in the high contrast themes.

  ![The dark high contrast theme now uses black as its selection foreground](images/1_68/terminal-contrast-foreground.png)

* Several bugs were fixed to make the resulting foreground color more correct.

As a reminder, minimum contrast ratio can be disabled if you would prefer original colors by setting `"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio": 1`.

## Source Control

### Branch prefix

To make the process of creating a new branch smoother, this milestone we have added a new setting, `git.branchPrefix`, that can be used to specify a string that will be used as a prefix when creating a new branch.

### Branch name generation

### Branch protection

## Notebooks

### Cell revealing changes

We made a some tweaks to how cells outside of the viewport get revealed in a couple scenarios.

When you click a cell in the Outline view, if that cell is outside of the viewport, the notebook will now scroll to reveal that cell at about the top 1/5th of the viewport. This matches the outline's behavior in the text editor.

When the cursor is in a cell editor, you can move the cursor past the first or last line of the editor to move it into the next cell editor. Now, when moving the cursor into an editor whose cell is out of the viewport, the notebook will scroll just enough to reveal that line in the editor, instead of jumping up to reveal the cell in the middle of the viewport.

### Find and Replace supports seeding query from cursor/selection

The Find Widget in notebook editor now supports seeding the search string from the editor selection. The behavior is controlled by the editor setting `editor.find.seedSearchStringFromSelection`

![Seed search string from editor selection in notebook](images/1_68/notebook-seed-search-from-selection.gif)

## Debugging

### Run and Debug without a launch.json

When you haven't set up a `launch.json` file and press `F5` or select the **Run and Debug** button in the Debug view, then we pick a debugger based on the language in the currently active file. If you don't have a file open, then we have to ask you which debugger you want to use. This experience can be a little confusing, so we've made a couple improvements.

![select debugger prompt](images/1_68/select-debugger.png)

If an extension was already activated before you tried to start debugging, then that extension's debugger will be sorted to the top. This will be useful, for example, when the extension was activated by previously running a command from that extension, or opening a file of a language that activates that extension, or by a workspaceContains pattern that your workspace matches. If you have used the debugger in this session, it will also be sorted to the top.

The Chrome/Edge debuggers have been renamed to Web App (Chrome) and Web App (Edge) to try to avoid confusion with other debuggers like Flutter's that also run apps in a browser.

## Languages

### TypeScript 4.7

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Go to Source Definition

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Object method snippets

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Group aware Organize Imports

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Strict null checks enabled in implicit projects

We've enabled [strict null checks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) in implicit projects by default for both JavaScript and TypeScript. This should result in more accurate IntelliSense and improved type checking that can catch common programming mistakes.

![A strict null error. getElementById may return null if no element with the id exists](images/1_68/ts-strict-null.png)

This new behavior only applies to any file that is not part of a `jsconfig` or `tsconfig` project. You can disable it by setting: `"js/ts.implicitProjectConfig.strictNullChecks": false`. For files that are part of a `jsconfig` or `tsconfig`, you still need to enable strict null checks in this config file.

### Go to Definition for Markdown reference links

You can now use `Go to definition` on [reference links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links) in Markdown files. This will jump from the reference to the link definition in the current file.

## VS Code for the Web

### Core localization support

We've introduced the initial localization support of VS Code for the Web. VS Code is used all over the world and to many users English is not their first language (or a language they're familiar with at all!). For years, users of VS Code have been installing [Language Packs from the Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=language%20pack&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) in order to use VS Code in a language other than English. For VS Code for the Web, we decided to take a different approach one that is more aligned with how the web works today.

For users who set their browser to one of our core supported languages, [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) will automatically apply translations in that language. The languages we support is documented in the [vscode-loc](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loc) repository.

So as an example, if I were to configure my language in Edge, I'd do so here:

![edge languages page](images/1_68/edge-translations.png)

Once that is set, I can go to [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) (or [insiders.vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev)) and see that it is in German:

![vscode in German](images/1_68/translations-core.png)

_Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda)_

In the next few months, we will enable localization for extensions (both ones that ship with VS Code and ones that don't) so that extension authors can support those non-English speaking users. Stay tuned!

## Development Container specification

Our development container teams across Microsoft and GitHub continue active development on the new [Dev Container Specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec), and this iteration had several exciting highlights.

### Reference implementation

We released an open source command-line interface (CLI) as the reference implementation for the specification. The CLI builds and starts a dev container from a `devcontainer.json`, and it can either be used directly or integrated into product experiences.

The CLI is available in a new [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) repository. You can learn how to get started in [its readme](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli#try-it-out), and read more in [this blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/05/18/dev-container-cli).

The CLI is under active development and will continue evolving to better support more scenarios, such as greater support for individual users. We'd love to hear your feedback along the way, so we've [opened an issue](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/issues/7) specifically for feedback on the CLI and welcome additional issues and PRs in the repo.

### Specification

Active development continues on the specification, and we've published an [initial version](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/main/docs/specs/devcontainer-reference.md) in the [devcontainers/spec](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec) repo.

As with the CLI, stay tuned for further updates and progress, and we'd love to hear your feedback.

### Further reading

You may read all about dev containers and the specification at [https://containers.dev/](https://containers.dev/).

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

**No interpreter discovery at startup**

The [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension now auto-triggers discovery only when:

* Using `Python: Select Interpreter` command to choose a different interpreter
* A particular scope (workspace or global) is opened for the first time
* No Python is installed

So discovery isn't triggered automatically at startup, leading to instantaneous load, and faster startup of other features like language server. However note that if [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension is installed/enabled, discovery is still triggered by Jupyter at startup.


**Enable localization**

The Python extension now supports translations in all the languages that VS Code supports. We have updated the way we get the translations of our commands, notifications, titles, etc. using vscode-nls. These translations are maintained by a localization team to ensure that they are up to date and correct, and are now stored in an [external repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extensions-loc), which will contain all VS Code extensions translations.

### Jupyter

**Web extension**

We've made progress on supporting more of the core functionality in the new web version of the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension.

This month we ported the following features to the web extension:

* https support
* kernel completions
* ipywidgets
* notebook debugging
* variable viewing
* exporting
* interactive window

If you'd like to experiment with the functionality, launch Jupyter from your local machine with:

```bash
jupyter notebook --no-browser --NotebookApp.allow_origin_pat=https://.*\.vscode-cdn\.net
```

And connect to it using the command **Jupyter: Specify Jupyter server for connections** from within vscode.dev.

For more information (and to comment), see this discussion [item](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/discussions/10315).

## Preview features

### Terminal shell integration

Shell integration and command decorations have been polished and improved upon this iteration.

A few of the updates include:

* [146377](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/146377) Persist shell status such that `bash-git-prompt` and other programs work
* [148635](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/148635) Allow the use of a custom `ZDOTDIR` for `zsh`
* [145801](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/145801) Fix decorations getting out of sync on slower machines
* [146873](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/146873) Improve handling of existing debug traps in `bash`
* [148839](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/148839) Polish messaging by removing the activation message from the buffer in favor of a `How does this work?` command action and activation status in the tab hover
* [151223](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/151223) After buffer clear, ensure commands are tracked correctly

### Window Controls Overlay on Windows

We've adopted the API provided by Electron to support [Window Controls Overlay](https://wicg.github.io/window-controls-overlay/) on Windows. The major user-facing benefit of this change is access to the [Snap Layouts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/apply-snap-layout-menu) feature in Windows 11. Due to some [persistent issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/150475), the Window Controls Overlay is off by default, but you can turn them on with the experimental setting `window.experimental.windowControlsOverlay.enabled`.

![Hover over the maximize/restore window control to see Windows 11 Snap layouts](images/1_68/snap-layouts.png)

### Markdown link diagnostics

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Copy paste files to insert Markdown link

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Extension authoring

### InputBox validation message severity finalization

Our InputBox APIs (via `window.showInputBox` and `window.createInputBox`) to[provide severity in validation of user's input](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L1990-L2002) has been finalized.

For example, if you wanted to show the user an information message based on their input, your validation message can return:

```ts
{ message: 'this is an info message'; severity: InputBoxValidationSeverity.Info }
```

which would look like this:

![Input box with 'this is an info message' severity message](images/1_68/inputboxseverity.png)

### Notebook Editor API finalized

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Extension activation based on timeline view
A new activation event has been added for when the timeline view is in view. This event `onView:timeline` can be used by any extension but is most useful to extensions implementing the proposed timeline API.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.
